    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>SkillSeek operates workforce-development bootcamps that train individuals for careers as HVAC technicians in the clean-energy industry. The programme combines a learner-centred curriculum with applied, on-the-job skills taught by experienced technicians — addressing the critical shortage of trained HVAC professionals as the US transitions to heat pumps and renewable energy systems.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered SkillSeek through a December 2025 Q&amp;A interview published on the Harvard Innovation Labs website, which profiled the founder's journey from HGSE to building a climate-aligned workforce venture. I then confirmed Priya Malhotra's HGSE '22 credentials on LinkedIn and reviewed the pilot programme results. The intersection of education, climate, and workforce development is a high-growth area with significant federal funding support (Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS Act), making this an attractive thematic investment for education-focused VCs.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptional pilot metrics:</strong> The first cohort achieved an 82% completion rate, 90% job-match rate, and 100% Net Promoter Score — metrics that would be impressive for any education programme. These results de-risk the model and provide a strong foundation for fundraising and scaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Massive structural tailwinds:</strong> The US faces a shortage of 110,000+ HVAC technicians, exacerbated by the IRA's push toward heat pump adoption. Over 80% of current HVAC positions are filled through personal connections, creating a huge equity gap that SkillSeek is uniquely positioned to address.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling challenges for in-person training:</strong> Unlike software-based edtech that scales globally with marginal cost near zero, in-person bootcamps require local facilities, instructors, and employer partnerships in each new market. Geographic expansion is inherently slower and more capital-intensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue model uncertainty:</strong> Workforce bootcamps can charge students (ISAs, upfront tuition), charge employers (recruitment fees), or both. The optimal pricing model for a population that includes "underserved communities" is unclear, and may conflict with the social mission if tuition is too high.</li>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your revenue model — do students pay tuition (upfront or through ISAs), do employers pay placement fees, or is it a hybrid?</li>
      <li>How many employer partners are committed to hiring your graduates, and what is the average starting salary for placed technicians?</li>
      <li>What is your plan for geographic expansion — will you open additional locations, partner with existing trade schools, or develop a hybrid online/in-person model?</li>
      <li>How do you differentiate from existing HVAC training programmes at community colleges and trade schools, which already have established employer relationships?</li>
      <li>With the Inflation Reduction Act creating massive demand for heat pump installation, how are you positioning SkillSeek to capture the specific heat-pump training opportunity vs. general HVAC?</li>
