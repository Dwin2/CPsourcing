    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Health Tech Without Borders through the Harvard Global Health Institute, which profiled Dr. Jarone Lee's work on health tech innovation. The founder's credentials — Harvard Medical School Associate Professor, Mass General Hospital Vice Chief of Critical Care, and over a decade of disaster response experience — provide exceptional clinical credibility. The organization's impact (65,000+ patients, 2,000+ clinicians trained) demonstrates meaningful scale in humanitarian health.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>World-class medical credibility:</strong> Founded by a Harvard Medical School professor and MGH critical care leader with 10+ years of disaster response experience. This pedigree opens doors to partnerships, grants, and volunteer clinicians that few organizations can match.</li>
        <li><strong>High-profile institutional partnerships:</strong> Clinton Global Initiative commitment, partnerships with VSee Health and iDocta, and collaboration with Harvard Global Health Institute provide legitimacy and potential funding pathways.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nonprofit model with grant dependency:</strong> Serving crisis regions is inherently difficult to monetize. The organization depends on grants and donations, which can be volatile and tied to donor priorities and geopolitical attention cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational complexity in crisis zones:</strong> Providing telehealth in humanitarian emergencies faces infrastructure challenges (internet connectivity, power), security concerns, and rapidly changing conditions. Sustained service delivery is extremely difficult.</li>
      </ul>
