    <p class="meta">Smart Patch — At-Home Urinary Incontinence Treatment</p>

  <div class="caution-box">
    <strong>Sourcing Note:</strong> InConfidence participated in Launch Lab X GEO (Harvard Innovation Labs). Consider framing discovery through the NSW Health Medical Devices Fund or ROHTO partnership announcements instead.

    <h3>1. Startup Name</h3>
    <p><strong>InConfidence</strong> (operated through Australis Scientific Pty Ltd)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>2. Founder Contact</h3>
    <p><strong>Nicky Agahari</strong> — CEO &amp; Founder</p>
    <p>Harvard Innovation Labs Fellow; based in Australia</p>
    <p>Website: <a href="https://www.inconfidence.io/" target="_blank">inconfidence.io</a></p>
    <p>LinkedIn: search "Nicky Agahari InConfidence"</p>

    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>InConfidence is developing a band-aid-like smart patch that delivers at-home posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) to treat urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. The patch stimulates the tibial nerve in the ankle, correcting the neural signal between bladder and brain — replacing costly, recurring in-clinic PTNS sessions.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed</strong> — Received <strong>$750,000</strong> from the NSW Health Medical Devices Fund (Australia) for clinical trials. Also received investment from <strong>ROHTO Pharmaceutical</strong> (Japan, October 2023). Part of Launch Lab X GEO 2023-2024 cohort.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found InConfidence through an article on the NSW Health Medical Research website about an innovative medical device being developed for incontinence. I then discovered the Harvard connection through the founder's fellowship at the Harvard Innovation Labs and his participation in the Launch Lab X GEO programme. The personal origin story — Agahari built the product after discovering his grandfather was one of 200 M+ people affected by urinary incontinence — adds authenticity to the venture. The clinical-trial stage and pharma partnership with ROHTO suggest meaningful technical validation.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive addressable market:</strong> Over 200 million people worldwide suffer from urinary incontinence, yet the condition is vastly under-treated due to stigma and inconvenient clinical options. An at-home, discreet wearable that replaces weekly clinic visits could unlock enormous latent demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic pharma validation:</strong> The investment from ROHTO Pharmaceutical — a major Japanese healthcare company — provides not just capital but potential distribution channels across Asia-Pacific, one of the fastest-growing medtech markets.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lengthy regulatory pathway:</strong> As a medical device delivering nerve stimulation, InConfidence will need regulatory clearance in every target market (TGA in Australia, FDA in the US, CE marking in Europe). This is a multi-year, capital-intensive process that introduces significant timeline risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic fragmentation:</strong> The company is based in Australia, received a Harvard fellowship in the US, and has a Japanese pharma partner. Managing operations, clinical trials, and regulatory submissions across three continents with limited resources is challenging for a pre-seed company.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What are the results from your initial clinical trial funded by the NSW Medical Devices Fund, and when do you expect to publish?</li>
      <li>What is your regulatory strategy — are you pursuing TGA approval in Australia first as a stepping stone, or going directly for FDA 510(k) clearance?</li>
      <li>How does the ROHTO partnership work in practice — is it a distribution agreement, a co-development arrangement, or a pure financial investment?</li>
      <li>What is the target price point for the smart patch, and how does that compare to the cost of in-clinic PTNS sessions (typically $200-400/session, 12 sessions needed)?</li>
      <li>How do you plan to address the stigma barrier in marketing — will you go DTC to consumers or work through urologists and primary care physicians?</li>
    </ol>
