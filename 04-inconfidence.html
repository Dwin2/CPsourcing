    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>InConfidence is developing a band-aid-like smart patch that delivers at-home posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) to treat urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. The patch stimulates the tibial nerve in the ankle, correcting the neural signal between bladder and brain — replacing costly, recurring in-clinic PTNS sessions.</p>

    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed</strong> — Received <strong>$750,000</strong> from the NSW Health Medical Devices Fund (Australia) for clinical trials. Also received investment from <strong>ROHTO Pharmaceutical</strong> (Japan, October 2023). Part of Launch Lab X GEO 2023-2024 cohort.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found InConfidence through an article on the NSW Health Medical Research website about an innovative medical device being developed for incontinence. I then discovered the Harvard connection through the founder's fellowship at the Harvard Innovation Labs and his participation in the Launch Lab X GEO programme. The personal origin story — Agahari built the product after discovering his grandfather was one of 200 M+ people affected by urinary incontinence — adds authenticity to the venture. The clinical-trial stage and pharma partnership with ROHTO suggest meaningful technical validation.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive addressable market:</strong> Over 200 million people worldwide suffer from urinary incontinence, yet the condition is vastly under-treated due to stigma and inconvenient clinical options. An at-home, discreet wearable that replaces weekly clinic visits could unlock enormous latent demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic pharma validation:</strong> The investment from ROHTO Pharmaceutical — a major Japanese healthcare company — provides not just capital but potential distribution channels across Asia-Pacific, one of the fastest-growing medtech markets.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lengthy regulatory pathway:</strong> As a medical device delivering nerve stimulation, InConfidence will need regulatory clearance in every target market (TGA in Australia, FDA in the US, CE marking in Europe). This is a multi-year, capital-intensive process that introduces significant timeline risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic fragmentation:</strong> The company is based in Australia, received a Harvard fellowship in the US, and has a Japanese pharma partner. Managing operations, clinical trials, and regulatory submissions across three continents with limited resources is challenging for a pre-seed company.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What are the results from your initial clinical trial funded by the NSW Medical Devices Fund, and when do you expect to publish?</li>
      <li>What is your regulatory strategy — are you pursuing TGA approval in Australia first as a stepping stone, or going directly for FDA 510(k) clearance?</li>
      <li>How does the ROHTO partnership work in practice — is it a distribution agreement, a co-development arrangement, or a pure financial investment?</li>
      <li>What is the target price point for the smart patch, and how does that compare to the cost of in-clinic PTNS sessions (typically $200-400/session, 12 sessions needed)?</li>
      <li>How do you plan to address the stigma barrier in marketing — will you go DTC to consumers or work through urologists and primary care physicians?</li>

    <h3>8. Draft Outreach Email</h3>
    <div class="email-box">
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with InConfidence?</p>
      <p>Hi Nicky,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following InConfidence's work in at-home urinary incontinence treatment through smart patch nerve stimulation and are impressed by the strategic investment from ROHTO Pharmaceutical and your NSW Health Medical Devices Fund grant for clinical trials — strong validation for a pre-seed medical device company. Given your Harvard Innovation Labs fellowship, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support InConfidence's growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
