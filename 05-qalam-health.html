    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Qalam Health Solutions develops innovative intraoperative cancer-detection devices that enable surgeons to identify bone cancer cells in tissue margins during surgery. The goal is to reduce cancer recurrence, minimise the need for re-operation, and optimise oncological outcomes through real-time surgical guidance.</p>

    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed / Grant-Funded</strong> — Has raised approximately <strong>$7K</strong> in disclosed equity funding. Received grant funding from the <strong>Quebec government</strong> (full-time salary support and operations), the <strong>INOVAIT Canada Pilot Fund</strong>, and participated in Centech Accelerator. Also part of Harvard Innovation Labs and V1 Studio. Based in Canada.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found Qalam Health Solutions by searching the Centech accelerator portfolio (a Canadian deep-tech incubator) for health-tech startups with Harvard affiliations. The founder's Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health credentials appeared in the company profile. The intraoperative diagnostics space is highly specialised with limited competition at the early stage, and the company's Canadian government grant funding provides non-dilutive runway — a positive signal for an early-stage medtech venture.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unmet clinical need:</strong> Positive surgical margins (incomplete tumour removal) in bone cancer surgeries lead to high recurrence rates and costly re-operations. A real-time, intraoperative detection tool addresses a clear gap where no established standard-of-care exists, giving Qalam first-mover advantage in a niche but critical clinical application.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-dilutive funding strategy:</strong> By leveraging Canadian government grants (Quebec, INOVAIT) and accelerator programmes, the founder has extended runway without heavy equity dilution — preserving upside for future investors while de-risking the technology through grant-funded validation work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Very early stage with minimal capital:</strong> With only ~$7K in disclosed equity funding, the company is extremely early. Moving from concept to a validated medical device requires significant capital for prototyping, clinical validation, and regulatory submissions — likely $2-5 M before any revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrow initial market:</strong> Bone cancer surgery is a relatively small surgical subspecialty. While the clinical need is acute, the total addressable market may be limited compared to broader oncology diagnostics. The company will need a clear expansion strategy into adjacent surgical applications to attract growth-stage investors.</li>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is the current state of your prototype — has it been tested ex-vivo, in animal models, or in any preliminary human studies?</li>
      <li>What is your regulatory pathway — are you pursuing Health Canada approval first, then FDA, or pursuing both in parallel?</li>
      <li>How does your detection technology work at a fundamental level — is it optical, spectroscopic, electrical, or based on another modality?</li>
      <li>Beyond bone cancer margins, what are the next surgical applications you envision for the platform, and how large are those markets?</li>
      <li>What is your fundraising plan for the next 18 months, and are you considering relocating to the US to access the deeper healthcare VC ecosystem?</li>

    <h3>8. Draft Outreach Email</h3>
    <div class="email-box">
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with Qalam Health Solutions?</p>
      <p>Hi Haitham,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following Qalam Health Solutions' work in intraoperative cancer diagnostics for bone cancer margin detection and are impressed by your innovative approach to a critical unmet clinical need — reducing cancer recurrence through real-time surgical guidance where no established standard-of-care currently exists. Given your Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health affiliation, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support Qalam Health Solutions' growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
