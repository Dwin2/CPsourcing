    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Sporo Health provides AI-powered clinical workflow tools — including Scribe AI and CoPilots — that automate patient chart reviews, medical note generation, and clinical summarisation. The platform integrates directly with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, reducing physician documentation burden across primary care, emergency medicine, and nursing facilities.</p>

    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Seed</strong> — Raised approximately <strong>$1.1 million</strong> in pre-seed funding. Latest seed round closed June 2024 (undisclosed amount), led by SBXi. Partnerships with Microsoft, Google for Startups, AWS Activate, and NVIDIA.</p>

  <!-- 5. How Found -->
  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I began by searching for early-stage digital health startups with Harvard-affiliated founders using public databases and Harvard alumni networks. Sporo Health appeared in the Harvard Innovation Labs' 2024 Year-in-Review milestone list, which highlighted ventures that had achieved significant traction. I cross-referenced the founding team's backgrounds on LinkedIn and confirmed the Harvard SEAS and Harvard Medical School affiliations. The company's focus on AI-driven clinical documentation — a rapidly growing segment of digital health — and its relatively modest funding made it stand out as an under-the-radar opportunity compared to larger players like Nuance/DAX.</p>

  <!-- 6. Strengths & Weaknesses -->
  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong technical moat:</strong> Sporo's specialised agentic architecture, trained on anonymised clinical transcripts, reportedly outperforms leading LLMs in recall and precision for SOAP note generation. This domain-specific fine-tuning creates defensibility against general-purpose AI entrants.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue-chip partnerships early:</strong> For a seed-stage company, securing partnerships with Microsoft, Google, AWS, and NVIDIA signals strong credibility and provides infrastructure advantages that reduce cloud costs and accelerate go-to-market.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crowded competitive landscape:</strong> AI medical scribing is increasingly commoditised with well-funded incumbents (e.g., Abridge at $250 M+ raised, Ambience Healthcare, Nuance/Microsoft DAX). Sporo must differentiate aggressively on integration depth and specialty-specific accuracy to avoid being squeezed.</li>
        <li><strong>Small team, limited capital:</strong> With only ~5 employees and modest funding relative to competitors, scaling sales and maintaining product velocity simultaneously will be challenging without a near-term fundraise.</li>

  <!-- 7. Five Questions -->
  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your current pipeline for EHR integrations, and how many health systems are actively using the product in production (vs. pilot)?</li>
      <li>How do you plan to defend your technical moat as foundational model providers (OpenAI, Google) release their own clinical documentation features natively inside EHR platforms?</li>
      <li>What is your current revenue model — per-provider SaaS subscription, per-encounter pricing, or enterprise site licence — and what does your unit economics look like at the current stage?</li>
      <li>With $1.1 M raised and ~5 employees, what is your runway, and when do you plan to raise your next round? What milestones are you targeting before that raise?</li>
      <li>The Forbes 30 Under 30 recognition and partnership logos are strong social proof — but what does your retention and NPS data look like from clinicians who have used the tool for 3+ months?</li>
