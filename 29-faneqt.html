    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered FanEQT through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator 2024 cohort announcement. While Sports Tech/Fintech is not strictly Digital Health or Education, the company represents an interesting application of fractional ownership models to sports — a space seeing increased attention from investors as traditional ownership structures evolve.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Novel approach to fan engagement:</strong> Fractional ownership gives fans a tangible stake in their teams beyond merchandise and tickets, potentially creating deeper loyalty and new revenue streams for sports organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing interest in alternative assets:</strong> Platforms like Rally, Masterworks, and Otis have proven demand for fractional ownership of collectibles and art. Sports assets could be a natural extension of this trend.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Different sector focus:</strong> FanEQT is a Sports Tech/Fintech company, not in the Digital Health or Education verticals.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex regulatory landscape:</strong> Fractional ownership of sports assets may involve securities regulations, which vary by jurisdiction and can be expensive to navigate. Compliance costs could be significant for an early-stage company.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is the legal/regulatory structure for fractional stadium ownership — are these securities offerings, revenue-sharing agreements, or another model?</li>
      <li>What sports organizations or venues have you partnered with or are in discussions with?</li>
      <li>What returns or benefits do fractional owners receive — dividends, perks, voting rights, or appreciation potential?</li>
      <li>How do you acquire customers — sports team marketing partnerships, direct-to-consumer, or social media?</li>
      <li>What is your minimum investment size, and who is your target customer demographic?</li>
    </ol>
