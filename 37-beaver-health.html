      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Growing market:</strong> Aging population and increased focus on cognitive health creates massive demand.</li>
        <li><strong>NIH validation:</strong> Federal grant funding demonstrates scientific credibility and de-risks early research.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early stage:</strong> Very early in development with limited traction data.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer behavior challenge:</strong> Engaging older adults with digital health tools requires careful UX design.</li>
