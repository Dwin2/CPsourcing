  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Urgent unmet need:</strong> Maternal mental health is severely underfunded despite affecting millions of women annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Employer benefit potential:</strong> Companies increasingly recognize postpartum support as critical for retention of working mothers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrow focus:</strong> Postpartum-specific positioning may limit total addressable market compared to broader mental health platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance coverage gaps:</strong> Mental health reimbursement remains challenging, especially for digital-first solutions.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>What clinical outcomes data do you have from your patient population?</li>
      <li>How do you differentiate from general mental health platforms like Talkspace or BetterHelp?</li>
      <li>What is your care model — licensed therapists, peer support, or hybrid?</li>
      <li>What expansion plans do you have beyond postpartum into broader maternal health?</li>
