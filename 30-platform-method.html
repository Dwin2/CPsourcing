  <div class="section">

    <p><strong>Adrian Washington</strong> — Founder</p>
    <p>Harvard affiliated</p>
    <p>HAE Accelerator 2024 cohort</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Platform is revolutionizing construction with the Platform Method™, a proprietary approach to building that aims to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and accelerate project timelines in the construction industry.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed</strong> — Part of Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator 2024 cohort (equity-free). Exact funding not publicly disclosed.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Platform through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator 2024 cohort announcement. While Construction Tech is not strictly Digital Health or Education, the company addresses a massive industry ($12T+ globally) that is notoriously slow to adopt technology. The HAE selection suggests the team and approach met rigorous evaluation criteria.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive market with technology adoption lag:</strong> The global construction industry exceeds $12 trillion annually but has had minimal productivity growth for decades. Solutions that genuinely improve efficiency could capture significant value.</li>
        <li><strong>HAE selection validation:</strong> The Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator selects from a competitive pool, suggesting the Platform Method™ approach passed initial due diligence.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Different sector focus:</strong> Platform is a Construction Tech company, not in the Digital Health or Education verticals.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited public information:</strong> Details about the Platform Method™ and the company's specific value proposition are not readily available, making assessment difficult without direct engagement.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What specifically is the Platform Method™ — is it a software platform, a construction methodology, or a combination?</li>
      <li>What construction segments are you targeting — residential, commercial, infrastructure, or a specific vertical?</li>
      <li>What measurable results (time savings, cost reduction, quality improvement) have you demonstrated?</li>
      <li>How do you go to market — direct to general contractors, through developers, or via technology licensing?</li>
      <li>What is your competitive differentiation versus other construction tech solutions (Procore, PlanGrid, etc.)?</li>
    </ol>
