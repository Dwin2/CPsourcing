    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Koroid through a Harvard Business School case study examining the company's scaling decisions after a successful Mass General Brigham pilot. The founder's dual Harvard credentials (HBS and HMS) and the MGH validation provided strong signals of both business and clinical credibility. Healthcare workforce management is a $2B+ market, and labor costs represent 50-60% of hospital operating expenses — creating significant ROI potential for optimization solutions.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Elite clinical validation:</strong> A successful pilot and deployment at Mass General Brigham — consistently ranked among America's top hospitals — provides exceptional reference value. This credential can open doors to other academic medical centers and large health systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Large, quantifiable ROI:</strong> Labor is 50-60% of hospital operating expenses. If Koroid can demonstrate even 3-5% efficiency gains through predictive staffing, the dollar savings for a large health system could be tens of millions annually — creating a compelling business case.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex enterprise sales cycle:</strong> Health system workforce decisions involve nursing leadership, HR, finance, IT, and union considerations. The multi-stakeholder sales cycle can extend 12-24 months, requiring significant capital and sales expertise to navigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive labor implications:</strong> Any workforce optimization tool faces scrutiny about whether "efficiency" means fewer staff or harder working conditions. Koroid must carefully position as enhancing care quality and staff satisfaction, not just cutting headcount.</li>
