    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Halo Braid is developing an automated hair-braiding robot that dramatically reduces the time required for protective braiding styles from 6+ hours to just 30 minutes. The technology addresses a significant pain point for millions of people who wear braided hairstyles — the lengthy, often uncomfortable process of getting braids done. The robotic system combines computer vision, precision mechanics, and AI to replicate the intricate work of professional braiders at a fraction of the time.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear, relatable pain point with large market:</strong> The Black haircare market in the US alone exceeds $2.5 billion annually. Millions of people endure 6+ hour braiding sessions regularly, creating strong demand for a faster, more convenient solution. The time savings (6hrs to 30min) represents a 12x improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong founding team with cultural insight:</strong> The founders bring both HBS business expertise and deep understanding of the target market's needs. This combination of business acumen and authentic connection to the problem is rare and valuable.</li>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Significant technical complexity:</strong> Hair braiding requires dexterity and adaptability that is extremely challenging to replicate robotically. Working with different hair textures, lengths, and styles adds layers of complexity that may prove difficult to solve at consumer price points.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware development challenges:</strong> Building, manufacturing, and distributing a consumer robotics product requires significant capital, supply chain expertise, and long development cycles. Hardware startups historically face higher failure rates than software companies.</li>
