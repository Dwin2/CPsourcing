    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Sugarwork is an enterprise SaaS platform that uses generative AI to help companies capture tacit knowledge — the undocumented expertise, relationships, and institutional memory that walks out the door when employees retire or leave. The platform enables knowledge transfer from aging workforces to newer employees.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Sugarwork through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator 2024 cohort announcement, then verified the founder's exceptional Harvard credentials — dual Harvard degrees plus current Board of Overseers membership. Vanessa Liu's enterprise SaaS experience (VP at SAP.iO, COO at Trigger Media) and board positions at Appen and Goodman Group provide unusual operational depth for an early-stage founder. The knowledge management market ($1T+ in lost productivity from knowledge loss annually) is large and growing as Baby Boomers retire.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptional founder pedigree:</strong> Dual Harvard degrees, Harvard Board of Overseers member, past Harvard Alumni Association President, former VP at SAP.iO, board member at public companies. This level of network and credibility is extraordinary for an early-stage startup.</li>
        <li><strong>Timely market need:</strong> 10,000 Baby Boomers retire daily in the US, taking decades of institutional knowledge with them. Generative AI enables new approaches to capturing tacit knowledge that weren't possible before, creating a technology timing advantage.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enterprise sales complexity:</strong> Knowledge management touches HR, IT, and business operations — requiring multi-stakeholder buy-in. Enterprise sales cycles can be 12-18 months, requiring significant capital and patience.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear differentiation in crowded space:</strong> Knowledge management has many established players (Notion, Confluence, Guru, Tettra). Sugarwork must clearly articulate how AI-powered tacit knowledge capture differs from existing documentation tools.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How does Sugarwork's approach to tacit knowledge capture differ technically from existing knowledge management platforms?</li>
      <li>What is your ideal customer profile — large enterprises with aging workforces, or mid-market companies with high turnover?</li>
      <li>How do you measure ROI for customers — knowledge retention metrics, onboarding time reduction, or productivity gains?</li>
      <li>What is your pricing model — per-user SaaS, enterprise license, or usage-based?</li>
      <li>Given your extensive network, are you primarily pursuing a founder-led sales model initially, or building a sales team?</li>
    </ol>

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with Sugarwork?</p>
      <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following Sugarwork's work in enterprise knowledge transfer and tacit knowledge capture and are impressed by your AI-powered platform addressing the critical challenge of institutional knowledge loss as 10,000 Baby Boomers retire daily. Given your dual Harvard degrees (AB and JD) and current position on the Harvard Board of Overseers, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support Sugarwork's growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
