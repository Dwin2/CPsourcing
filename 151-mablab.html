    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive public health need:</strong> Over 100,000 annual overdose deaths in the US, with fentanyl contamination being a leading cause. Harm reduction approach is gaining mainstream acceptance and policy support.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple, scalable product:</strong> Lateral flow test strips are low-cost to manufacture at scale, similar to COVID rapid tests. The 5-in-1 format provides more value than single-analyte competitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Early validation:</strong> PIC win demonstrates investor and institutional support for the mission. Harvard affiliation provides credibility and access to research resources.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulatory complexity:</strong> Drug testing products face FDA oversight and varying state regulations around harm reduction products. Navigating approval pathways could delay market entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution challenges:</strong> Reaching target users (recreational drug users, harm reduction organizations, nightlife venues) requires non-traditional distribution channels and may face stigma barriers.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your FDA regulatory strategy — are you pursuing 510(k) clearance or going OTC/direct-to-consumer initially?</li>
      <li>How does your 5-in-1 sensitivity and specificity compare to existing single-analyte fentanyl test strips?</li>
      <li>What is your target unit cost and retail price point at scale, and how does this compare to existing harm reduction products?</li>
      <li>Are you targeting B2B (harm reduction orgs, clinics, festivals) or B2C (direct consumer) distribution first?</li>
      <li>What is your manufacturing timeline, and do you have a contract manufacturer lined up for scale production?</li>
