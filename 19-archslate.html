    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Archslate is an AI-powered marketplace that transforms hiring and upskilling in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The platform uses algorithms to match architects and designers with employers, addressing the inefficient, network-dependent hiring practices that dominate the industry.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed</strong> — Raised oversubscribed <strong>$700K pre-seed round</strong>. Part of Harvard i-Lab Venture Incubation and Launch Lab X GEO 2023-2024. Landed first paying user within one day of Beta launch with 150% week-over-week growth. Relocated from Silicon Valley to Tampa.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Archslate through Business Observer Florida coverage of the company's pre-seed funding and relocation to Tampa. The founder's personal pain point — spending 6 months and 200 applications to find an architecture job after Harvard GSD — creates authentic founder-market fit. The AEC industry employs 11M+ workers in the US but lacks modern hiring infrastructure compared to tech, creating significant market opportunity.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underserved vertical with clear pain point:</strong> The AEC industry lacks dedicated hiring platforms comparable to what tech has with LinkedIn/Hired. The founder's personal 6-month job search demonstrates the problem firsthand. First-mover advantage in a specific vertical can create strong network effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong early traction signals:</strong> Landing the first paying user within one day of Beta launch and achieving 150% weekly growth indicates product-market fit. The oversubscribed $700K pre-seed round validates investor interest.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marketplace chicken-and-egg challenge:</strong> Two-sided marketplaces require both job seekers and employers. Building liquidity on both sides simultaneously is notoriously difficult and capital-intensive, especially in a traditional industry less accustomed to online hiring.</li>
        <li><strong>AEC industry adoption may be slow:</strong> Architecture and construction firms tend to be conservative adopters of new technology. Convincing hiring managers to change from network-based hiring to platform-based hiring may require significant education and behavior change.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your current marketplace liquidity — how many active job seekers and employers are on the platform?</li>
      <li>What is your revenue model — job posting fees, placement fees, subscriptions, or freemium with premium features?</li>
      <li>How does your AI matching algorithm work, and what data signals does it use beyond traditional resume parsing?</li>
      <li>Are you focused on architecture specifically, or expanding into the broader AEC (engineering, construction) market?</li>
      <li>What is your path to Series A — what metrics (placements, revenue, employer count) are you targeting?</li>
    </ol>
