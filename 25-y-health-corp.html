  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Y-Health Corp through New York Weekly coverage of the founder's work in behavioral health innovation. Michael Spano Jr.'s combined experience as a Harvard research fellow, mobile crisis counselor, and 988 lifeline counselor provides authentic understanding of the mental health system's failures. The personal origin story — witnessing patients with serious mental illness struggle with long waits and navigation challenges — demonstrates genuine founder-market fit.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deep clinical experience informing product:</strong> The founder's dual background as Harvard research fellow AND frontline crisis counselor creates rare combination of academic rigor and practical system understanding. The product directly addresses problems he witnessed in the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis-focused differentiation:</strong> While many mental health platforms target consumers or employers, Y-Health focuses on crisis teams and clinicians — a B2B segment with urgent needs and potentially faster adoption cycles.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data maintenance challenge:</strong> A provider directory with real-time availability requires constant updates. Mental health provider information changes frequently, and maintaining data accuracy at scale is operationally intensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmented market and local dynamics:</strong> Mental health resources are highly localized. Scaling beyond initial markets (Yonkers, Westchester County) requires rebuilding provider databases in each new geography.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How do you maintain real-time accuracy of provider availability data? Do providers update directly, or do you use other data sources?</li>
      <li>What is your revenue model — subscription from crisis teams, provider listings, or health system contracts?</li>
      <li>How many crisis teams or clinicians are currently using the platform, and what geographies do you serve?</li>
      <li>What is your geographic expansion strategy — market by market, or partnerships with national crisis networks?</li>
      <li>How does Y-Health integrate with existing crisis response workflows and systems?</li>
    </ol>
