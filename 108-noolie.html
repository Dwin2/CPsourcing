    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addressing critical health need in large market:</strong> Southeast Asia has over 650 million people, with childhood malnutrition affecting millions. The children's nutrition and supplement market is growing rapidly as middle-class parents increasingly invest in their children's health.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovative product-market fit:</strong> By disguising supplements as tasty snacks, Noolie solves the compliance problem that plagues traditional children's vitamins. Kids actually want to eat the product, driving consistent usage and health outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulatory complexity across multiple countries:</strong> Southeast Asia comprises many countries with different food and supplement regulations. Navigating these varying requirements adds complexity and cost to expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>Competition from established brands:</strong> Global nutrition companies like Nestle, Abbott, and others already have strong presence in Southeast Asian children's nutrition. They have established distribution networks and marketing capabilities.</li>
      </ul>
