    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Mind Brain Emotion through a CNBC profile on Dr. Jenny Woo's journey from Harvard research to building a $1.7M Amazon business. The company represents an interesting bootstrapped success story in the education/mental health space. The founder's Harvard M.Ed. credential and background as a Montessori school director provide educational credibility.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proven profitability without VC:</strong> Generating $1.71M revenue in 2023 from a $1,000 initial investment demonstrates exceptional capital efficiency and product-market fit. The business doesn't require venture funding to grow, which is rare in edtech.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple credibility signals:</strong> Featured by Forbes, CNBC, Fortune, and Parents magazine. The "52 Essential" card series has become a recognized brand in the SEL (social-emotional learning) space, creating defensible brand equity.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon dependency creates platform risk:</strong> Primary sales channel is Amazon, which means the business is subject to Amazon's algorithm changes, fee increases, and competitive dynamics. Diversifying distribution is a key risk mitigation priority.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical product margins and logistics:</strong> Card games require manufacturing, inventory management, and shipping — creating complexity and lower margins compared to purely digital products. International expansion adds further logistical challenges.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your channel diversification strategy beyond Amazon — are you pursuing direct sales, school district partnerships, or retail expansion?</li>
      <li>Have you considered digital versions of the card games (apps, online platforms) that could reduce manufacturing dependency and expand addressable market?</li>
      <li>What is your gross margin on physical card products, and how does that trend as you scale?</li>
      <li>How do you measure the educational efficacy of the card games — is there research validating EQ skill improvement from using the products?</li>
      <li>Are you seeking growth capital to accelerate expansion, or do you prefer to remain bootstrapped and profitable?</li>
