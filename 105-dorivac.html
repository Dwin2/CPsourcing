    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>DoriVac is developing a novel cancer immunotherapy platform based on DNA nanoparticle technology originating from Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. The technology uses programmable DNA origami structures to deliver cancer antigens and immunostimulatory signals directly to the immune system, potentially enabling more effective and personalized cancer vaccines. This approach represents a new frontier in immuno-oncology.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cutting-edge platform technology from premier institution:</strong> DNA origami and nanoparticle technology from the Wyss Institute represents some of the most advanced bioengineering research in the world. This scientific foundation provides strong IP and differentiation from other cancer vaccine approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Large and growing market for cancer immunotherapy:</strong> The global cancer immunotherapy market exceeds $100 billion and is growing rapidly. Cancer vaccines, particularly personalized approaches, are receiving significant attention and investment from pharma and biotech investors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Long development timelines and high capital requirements:</strong> Biotech startups, especially in oncology, require many years and hundreds of millions of dollars to reach FDA approval. The path from early-stage research to commercialization is long and uncertain.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical and regulatory risk:</strong> Many promising cancer therapies fail in clinical trials. The FDA approval process is rigorous, and there is no guarantee that preclinical success will translate to human efficacy and safety.</li>
      </ul>
