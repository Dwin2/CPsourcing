    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>SeaCycle transforms seafood industry waste into valuable biopolymers, creating sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. The company extracts chitin and chitosan from shrimp shells, crab exoskeletons, and other seafood byproducts that would otherwise be discarded. These biopolymers have applications in packaging, agriculture, cosmetics, and biomedical products, offering a circular economy solution that addresses both waste management and plastic pollution challenges.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual value proposition addressing waste and plastics:</strong> SeaCycle solves two problems simultaneously — diverting millions of tons of seafood waste from landfills while producing sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. This circular economy model is increasingly attractive to investors and corporate customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing market for sustainable materials:</strong> The global biopolymer market is projected to exceed $15 billion by 2027, driven by regulations limiting single-use plastics and consumer demand for sustainable products. Major CPG companies are actively seeking bio-based packaging alternatives.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling production is challenging:</strong> Building industrial-scale biopolymer production facilities requires significant capital and technical expertise. The economics of extracting chitin from seafood waste must compete with existing petroleum-based alternatives at scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply chain complexity:</strong> Sourcing consistent, quality seafood waste requires relationships with seafood processors and may involve geographic constraints. Seasonality and variability in waste streams could affect production consistency.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>8. Draft Outreach Email</h3>
    <div class="email-box">
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Interested in SeaCycle's Circular Economy Approach</p>
      <p>Hi Hande and Jakob,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following SeaCycle's work in transforming seafood waste into biopolymers with great interest. Your circular economy approach addresses both the seafood industry's waste problem and the growing demand for sustainable plastic alternatives — a compelling dual value proposition in the $15B+ biopolymer market.</p>
      <p>Given your HBS '25 background and the exciting potential of your technology, we'd love to learn more about your vision for SeaCycle and explore how HUCP might support your journey to commercial scale.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your HBS schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
