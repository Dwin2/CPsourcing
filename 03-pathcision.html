    <h3>1. Startup Name</h3>
    <p><strong>PathCision Medicine, Inc.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>2. Founder Contact</h3>
    <p><strong>David Lee, MD PhD</strong> — Co-Founder &amp; CSO</p>
    <p>Affiliated with Harvard Medical School – Massachusetts General Hospital</p>
    <p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidyanglee/" target="_blank">linkedin.com/in/davidyanglee</a></p>

    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>PathCision Medicine develops next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that selectively target metastatic cancer using a proprietary multi-omics discovery platform combining machine learning with deep biological insights. Their leading programme focuses on metastasis-selective delivery across multiple indications.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Seed</strong> — Raised <strong>$800K</strong>. Investors include Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs and MassBio. Also selected for Launch Lab X and MassBioDrive (Fall 2023). Founded 2022, based in Watertown, MA.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered PathCision Medicine through the MassBio member directory, which lists early-stage biotech startups in Massachusetts. I then cross-referenced the founding team on LinkedIn and confirmed David Lee's Harvard Medical School / MGH affiliation. The company's focus on ADCs — a segment that saw $7 B+ in M&amp;A activity in 2023-2024 (Pfizer/Seagen, AbbVie/ImmunoGen) — makes it particularly interesting from an investment thesis perspective. The combination of computational biology and clinical oncology expertise in the founding team is compelling.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hot therapeutic category:</strong> ADCs are one of the most active areas in biopharma M&amp;A and partnering. Pfizer's $43 B acquisition of Seagen and AbbVie's $10 B ImmunoGen deal validate enormous acquirer appetite, giving PathCision a clear exit pathway even at early stages.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep scientific credentials:</strong> David Lee's MD/PhD background, combined with experience at Novartis, Jounce Therapeutics, and Pyxis Oncology, provides the translational expertise needed to advance from discovery through IND-enabling studies. The multi-omics platform adds a computational moat.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital-intensive path to value inflection:</strong> Biopharma development is expensive. $800K is enough for early discovery but reaching IND-enabling studies typically requires $5-15 M. The company will need significant follow-on capital, and biotech fundraising remains challenging for pre-clinical stage companies.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary risk profile:</strong> Unlike SaaS companies with recurring revenue, biotech startups face binary outcomes — the science either works or it doesn't. Investors must be comfortable with the risk that preclinical results may not translate to clinical efficacy.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is the timeline and capital required to reach your first IND filing, and what is your fundraising strategy to bridge that gap?</li>
      <li>How does your multi-omics discovery platform compare to other computational approaches in the ADC space (e.g., those used by Mythic Therapeutics or Synaffix)?</li>
      <li>What is the mechanism of metastasis-selectivity in your lead ADC, and how does it differ from standard ADC targeting approaches?</li>
      <li>Have you engaged with any pharmaceutical partners for co-development or licensing discussions, and what would an ideal partnership structure look like?</li>
      <li>What are the key preclinical milestones you expect to hit in the next 12 months that would de-risk the programme for Series A investors?</li>
    </ol>
