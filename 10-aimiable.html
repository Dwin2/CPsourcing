    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Aimiable is an AI-powered workforce engagement management (WEM) SaaS platform for customer support teams. It provides intelligent forecasting, scheduling, and routing for hybrid human + AI bot support operations — automating the repetitive workforce management tasks that consume support team leads' time.</p>

    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed</strong> — Participated in the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs (HAE) Accelerator 2024 cohort (equity-free). Venture-funded; exact amount not publicly disclosed. Previously, Olga scaled Unqork from $50 M to $2 B valuation as VP of Customer Enablement.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>Discovered through the HAE Accelerator 2024 cohort list, then confirmed the Harvard Business School affiliation via an Authority Magazine interview and LinkedIn. The founders' combined experience (Harvard MBA, McKinsey, Microsoft, Twitter, Spotify, scaling a unicorn) represents an unusually strong team for a pre-seed venture. The customer support WEM market ($3.5B+) is ripe for AI disruption.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptional founder pedigree:</strong> Olga's experience scaling Unqork from $50 M to $2 B valuation, combined with McKinsey and Microsoft backgrounds, provides operational credibility. Kelly Wu's experience at Twitter and Spotify brings product expertise in building tools at scale. This is a rare team combination for a pre-seed company.</li>
        <li><strong>Timely market inflection:</strong> As companies deploy AI chatbots for customer support, managing the hybrid human + bot workforce becomes a new, unsolved challenge. Traditional WEM tools (NICE, Verint, Calabrio) were not designed for AI-augmented teams. Aimiable is building natively for this new paradigm, giving it a structural advantage over incumbents.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Niche positioning:</strong> Aimiable is focused on workforce management rather than traditional education, limiting its appeal to education-focused investors.</li>
        <li><strong>Incumbent competition is fierce:</strong> The WEM / WFM market is dominated by well-funded incumbents (NICE, Verint, Genesys, Calabrio) who have existing enterprise relationships and are rapidly adding AI features. Aimiable must compete on innovation speed and niche focus (hybrid AI teams) to carve out share.</li>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How many customer support teams are currently using Aimiable in production, and what is your average contract value?</li>
      <li>How does your AI forecasting accuracy compare to incumbent WEM tools (NICE, Verint) in head-to-head testing?</li>
      <li>What is your ideal customer profile — SMB support teams, mid-market, or enterprise? How does your GTM strategy differ by segment?</li>
      <li>How do you handle the "cold start" problem for new customers — does your forecasting model require significant historical data to deliver value, or can it provide benefits from day one?</li>
      <li>What is your fundraising plan — are you raising a seed round, and what milestones are you targeting (ARR, customer count, logo quality) before that raise?</li>
