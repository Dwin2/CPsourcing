    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Fiduciary in a Box is a SaaS platform that guides employers through establishing, documenting, and maintaining a fiduciary process for their health benefits plans, as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) 2021. The tool walks employers through each step — from forming a governing committee to documenting strategies — reducing legal risk and ensuring ERISA compliance.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found Fiduciary in a Box through the HAE Accelerator 2024 cohort press release. The company stood out because it sits at the intersection of health-tech and regulatory compliance — a category that tends to be recession-resistant and driven by legislative mandates rather than discretionary budgets. Jed Cohen's background as a serial entrepreneur (co-founded RocketHub, one of the first crowdfunding platforms; scaled Outcome Health past a $5 B valuation) combined with his Harvard College affiliation makes this a strong founder-investor fit. The CAA 2021 created a new legal obligation for every ERISA-covered employer, creating a large, underserved TAM practically overnight.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulation-driven demand:</strong> The CAA 2021 imposed new fiduciary duties on employers' healthcare plans, and a wave of class-action lawsuits is expected. This creates urgent, non-discretionary demand for compliance tools — employers don't have a choice about whether to comply, only how. FIAB converts a legal mandate into recurring SaaS revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Experienced serial founder:</strong> Jed Cohen co-founded RocketHub (acquired 2015), helped scale Outcome Health to $5 B valuation, and served as COO of Venture for America. This level of operational and entrepreneurial experience at a pre-seed stage is unusual and significantly de-risks execution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Niche within a niche:</strong> Health-plan fiduciary compliance is a narrow category. While the legislative mandate creates urgency, the product may face challenges expanding beyond this single use case. If the regulatory landscape shifts or enforcement proves lax, demand could plateau.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive threat from incumbents:</strong> Benefits administration platforms (Mercer, Aon, Willis Towers Watson) and existing compliance software providers could add fiduciary documentation features as modules, leveraging their existing employer relationships and distribution advantages.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How many employers are currently using the platform, and what is your pricing model (per-employee, flat SaaS fee, or tiered by company size)?</li>
      <li>How are you acquiring customers — direct sales to HR teams, partnerships with benefits brokers/consultants, or through legal/compliance channels?</li>
      <li>What is your product roadmap beyond CAA compliance — do you plan to expand into retirement-plan fiduciary documentation or broader benefits administration?</li>
      <li>How do you differentiate from a benefits consultant who could provide the same fiduciary documentation as a service rather than software?</li>
      <li>What does your competitive moat look like in 3 years if large benefits platforms (e.g., Mercer, Aon) add fiduciary compliance modules to their existing suites?</li>
