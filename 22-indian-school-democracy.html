    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Indian School of Democracy through the Harvard Kennedy School Mittal South Asia Institute, which profiled Hemakshi Meghani's work on political leadership training. The founder's Harvard Kennedy School background, including exposure to programs like "Harvard Square to Oval Office," directly informed the ISD model. The Echoing Green Fellowship (highly selective, only 18 fellows globally in 2022) provides additional validation of social impact potential.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unique positioning in massive market:</strong> India has 1.4B people and the world's largest democracy, yet there is no established institution training ethical political leaders. ISD is creating a new category with first-mover advantage in an enormous addressable population.</li>
        <li><strong>Prestigious validation:</strong> Echoing Green Fellowship (highly competitive global social entrepreneurship program) and World Bank Graduate Scholar background provide credibility with funders and attract high-quality applicants to the programs.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Long time to measurable impact:</strong> Training political leaders today may not result in elected officials for years or decades. Demonstrating impact to funders requires patience and long-term tracking of alumni career progression.</li>
        <li><strong>Political sensitivity:</strong> Operating a "political training school" in India requires careful navigation of partisan dynamics. Maintaining genuine non-partisanship while training people for inherently political roles is challenging.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How many alumni have run for office, and how many have been elected? What is your track record of placing graduates into political positions?</li>
      <li>How do you maintain non-partisan credibility when training people who will align with different political parties?</li>
      <li>What is your selection process for program participants — how do you identify candidates with genuine leadership potential?</li>
      <li>What is your revenue model — participant fees, foundation grants, government funding, or a hybrid?</li>
      <li>Are you considering expansion beyond India to other democracies with similar needs (e.g., other South Asian countries, Africa)?</li>
