    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Games for Ed designs low-tech board and card games aligned to India's K-12 national curriculum, targeting five core skills: communication, problem-solving, teamwork, logical thinking, and multitasking. The games are specifically built for classrooms with minimal technology access, and the programme includes teacher training on game-based pedagogy.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found Games for Ed through a Harvard Crimson article from October 2025 profiling HGSE alumni who were building education ventures in emerging markets. The co-founder Mridula Chalamalasetti's HGSE '25 affiliation was confirmed through the LDIT programme page. I was drawn to this venture because it addresses a fundamentally different challenge than most edtech: delivering learning outcomes in low-resource, low-connectivity environments where digital tools simply don't work. India's K-12 market (260 M+ students) is the world's largest, and the "low-tech for low-resource" approach is refreshingly contrarian in an edtech landscape obsessed with AI and digital platforms.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counter-cyclical to edtech hype:</strong> While most edtech startups require devices and connectivity, Games for Ed works in classrooms with zero technology. This "low-tech" approach means no infrastructure dependency, near-zero per-student distribution cost (a board game costs under $2 to produce at scale), and resilience against the digital-divide critique that plagues many edtech ventures.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong early traction and evidence:</strong> A 28% average improvement in classroom metrics, successful teacher training programmes, and enthusiastic school testimonials provide early evidence of efficacy — crucial for an education venture seeking to scale through school district partnerships or government adoption.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unclear revenue model and scalability:</strong> With only a $5K grant and no disclosed venture funding, the venture's business model is uncertain. Selling low-cost physical games to price-sensitive Indian schools may struggle to generate the unit economics that attract venture capital. The venture may be better suited as a social enterprise or NGO than a VC-backed startup.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited moat:</strong> Board and card games, once designed, can be easily copied or replicated by local manufacturers. Without IP protection, brand defensibility, or network effects, a successful product could be cloned by better-resourced competitors or even by the schools themselves.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your business model — do you sell games directly to schools, to government education departments, or through a B2B distributor?</li>
      <li>How do you protect your IP when the games can be physically replicated? Is the moat in the game design itself, the teacher training programme, or the curriculum alignment?</li>
      <li>What is your path to reaching 1,000+ schools — is it through individual school sales, state government adoption, or partnerships with education NGOs like Pratham or Teach For India?</li>
      <li>Have you considered digitising the game designs for schools that do have device access, creating a hybrid physical/digital product line?</li>
      <li>Are you structured as a for-profit company or a non-profit/social enterprise, and what type of capital (venture, impact, philanthropic) are you seeking?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>8. Draft Outreach Email</h3>
    <div class="email-box">
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with Games for Ed?</p>
      <p>Hi Mridula,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following Games for Ed's work in low-tech game-based learning for K-12 classrooms in India and are impressed by your 28% average improvement in classroom metrics and your refreshingly contrarian approach of building for low-resource environments rather than chasing digital-first solutions. Given your Harvard Graduate School of Education '25 affiliation in Learning Design, Innovation & Technology, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support Games for Ed's growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
