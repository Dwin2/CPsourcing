    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Ivystar is a beta productivity platform designed specifically for youth (ages 13-22), combining task management, goal setting, habit tracking, and peer mentorship. The platform pairs users with near-peer mentors from top universities who provide accountability and guidance. Unlike generic productivity apps, Ivystar is designed around the unique challenges facing Gen Z students: digital distraction, academic pressure, and lack of structured guidance outside the classroom.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underserved demographic:</strong> Most productivity tools are designed for adults/professionals. Gen Z has distinct needs around digital wellness, academic balance, and peer-driven motivation that existing tools don't address.</li>
        <li><strong>Near-peer mentorship model:</strong> Research shows students respond better to mentors close to their age. Having Ivy League mentors creates aspirational appeal while maintaining relatability.</li>
        <li><strong>Network effects potential:</strong> As more students join and become mentors themselves, the platform can create a self-sustaining flywheel of users and mentors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crowded productivity app market:</strong> Notion, Todoist, and other general productivity apps are well-established. Differentiation through youth focus may not be defensible long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentor supply constraints:</strong> Scaling high-quality mentors from top universities is challenging and labor-intensive. Quality control at scale is a significant operational hurdle.</li>
        <li><strong>Youth monetization challenges:</strong> Target users (teens) have limited spending power. Business model may depend on parents or institutions paying, adding sales complexity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Intro to Ivystar?</p>
      <p>Hi [Founder Name],</p>

      <p>We've been tracking the growing interest in youth productivity and mentorship platforms, and Ivystar's approach of combining task management with near-peer mentorship is compelling. As Harvard students ourselves, we understand the value of structured guidance and accountability. We'd love to learn more about your beta progress and how HUCP might support your growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a brief introductory call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
