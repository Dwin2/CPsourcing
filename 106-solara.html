    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Solara provides on-demand solar-powered irrigation services to smallholder farmers in India. Rather than requiring farmers to purchase expensive solar pump systems outright, Solara offers irrigation-as-a-service, making clean energy accessible to farmers who need it most. The model addresses both the water access challenges facing Indian agriculture and the need for sustainable alternatives to diesel-powered irrigation pumps.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive addressable market with urgent need:</strong> India has over 100 million smallholder farmers, many of whom struggle with unreliable electricity and expensive diesel for irrigation. The government is actively promoting solar adoption in agriculture through subsidies and policy support.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovative service model reduces adoption barriers:</strong> By offering irrigation-as-a-service rather than selling equipment, Solara makes solar irrigation accessible to farmers who cannot afford large capital expenditures. This model has proven successful in other emerging market contexts.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Challenging unit economics in rural India:</strong> Serving smallholder farmers in rural areas involves high operational costs for equipment deployment, maintenance, and payment collection. Achieving profitability requires significant scale and operational efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Competition from subsidized alternatives:</strong> Indian government solar pump subsidy programs may compete with Solara's service model. Additionally, other solar irrigation startups and traditional equipment vendors are active in the market.</li>
      </ul>
