    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Inqui-Lab Foundation through the Harvard Kennedy School Cheng Fellows program, which selects exceptional students advancing social change. Cross-referencing the founder's HGSE '23 affiliation, I found the organization's focus on design thinking and problem-solving for marginalized Indian students. The tangible student projects — from eco-friendly medicine bags with braille instructions to wheelchair-accessible car seat designs — demonstrate real creative output.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on underserved population with high potential:</strong> First-generation learners in India represent enormous untapped potential. By building problem-solving skills early, Inqui-Lab may produce outsized long-term impact as these students enter the workforce.</li>
        <li><strong>Tangible, portfolio-ready student outcomes:</strong> Student projects (medicine bags, wheelchair car seats) demonstrate that the program produces real innovations, not just abstract "skill development." These outputs make compelling marketing material for funders and partners.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scale limitations for in-school programs:</strong> Working directly with government schools in India requires navigating bureaucracy and teacher training in each new location. This creates inherent scaling challenges compared to digital-first approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Nonprofit model limits growth capital:</strong> As a registered nonprofit, Inqui-Lab cannot access venture capital. Growth depends on grant funding and donations, which may be slower and less predictable than equity financing.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your cost per student served, and how does that compare to other innovation education programs in India?</li>
      <li>How do you train teachers in government schools to facilitate design thinking? What does teacher adoption and retention look like?</li>
      <li>Have any student projects from Inqui-Lab been commercialized or patented? Is there a pathway from classroom innovation to real-world implementation?</li>
      <li>What are your plans for geographic expansion within India — are you focused on specific states, or pursuing national-level partnerships?</li>
      <li>Are you considering a hybrid model with digital components that could scale beyond the 30 schools you currently serve?</li>
    </ol>
