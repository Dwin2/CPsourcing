    <p>La Huerta de Elisa is pioneering Mexico's first all-natural baby food brand, providing parents with healthy, organic options free from preservatives and artificial additives.

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First-mover advantage in large, growing market:</strong> Mexico's baby food market is valued at over $1 billion, and Latin American parents are increasingly demanding healthier options. As the first all-natural brand, La Huerta de Elisa can establish strong brand loyalty before competition intensifies.</li>
        <li><strong>Riding global clean-label trends:</strong> The shift toward natural, organic, and preservative-free baby food has transformed the US and European markets. Latin America is following this trend with a growing middle class willing to pay premium prices for healthier baby products.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Competition from well-resourced multinationals:</strong> Large baby food companies like Gerber (Nestle), Heinz, and others have significant distribution networks and marketing budgets. They could quickly launch natural product lines to compete with La Huerta de Elisa.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges in scaling food production:</strong> Building a food brand requires managing complex supply chains, ensuring consistent quality, navigating food safety regulations, and establishing retail distribution — all of which require significant operational expertise and capital.</li>
