    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Meomind offers on-demand access to 600+ pre-recorded therapy sessions and interactive mental health tools for personalized self-care. The platform uses "vicarious therapy" — allowing users to experience therapeutic sessions as observers — as a scalable solution to the mental health clinician shortage.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Meomind through Behavioral Health Business, which covered the company's unique "vicarious therapy" approach to scaling mental health access. Cross-referencing on Crunchbase, I confirmed the Harvard Business School affiliation of CEO Sushant Gupta, who was previously Director of Strategy at OptumHealth. The company's B2B model (employers pay per-member-per-month fees) and focus on reducing employee burnout positions it in the $20B+ corporate wellness market.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalable solution to clinician shortage:</strong> With 150M+ Americans in areas with mental health provider shortages, Meomind's recorded-session model bypasses the supply constraint entirely. One therapy session can serve unlimited viewers, creating near-zero marginal cost per user.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise B2B model with clear buyer:</strong> By targeting employers through per-member-per-month pricing, Meomind has a well-defined customer (HR/benefits buyers) with budget authority and a clear value proposition (reduced burnout, lower healthcare costs).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinical efficacy questions:</strong> "Vicarious therapy" — watching others' therapy sessions — is a novel modality without the evidence base of traditional CBT or other established treatments. Skeptical employers and clinical reviewers may question whether recorded sessions deliver therapeutic benefit comparable to live interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Crowded mental health benefits market:</strong> Meomind competes with well-funded players like Spring Health ($350M+ raised), Lyra Health ($900M+ raised), and Headspace Health. Differentiation in the corporate mental health space is increasingly difficult.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What clinical evidence or studies support the efficacy of "vicarious therapy" compared to traditional one-on-one sessions?</li>
      <li>How many enterprise customers have adopted Meomind, and what is your average contract size and retention rate?</li>
      <li>How do you measure clinical outcomes for users — do you track symptom improvement using validated scales like PHQ-9 or GAD-7?</li>
      <li>What is your content creation process — how do you ensure the 600+ recorded sessions cover diverse therapeutic needs and remain clinically current?</li>
      <li>How do you handle users who need more intensive support than recorded sessions can provide — is there an escalation path to live care?</li>
    </ol>
