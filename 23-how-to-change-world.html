    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered How to Change the World through the Harvard Innovation Labs venture directory, which lists HKS-affiliated education ventures. The focus on translating academic knowledge into real-world impact skills addresses a common criticism of higher education — that graduates lack practical problem-solving abilities. The venture aligns with growing demand for skills-based credentials and experiential learning.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addresses recognized gap in higher education:</strong> Employers consistently report that graduates lack practical skills to apply academic knowledge. A program focused specifically on this translation could find strong demand from both universities and employers.</li>
        <li><strong>HKS credibility for policy/impact focus:</strong> Harvard Kennedy School's reputation in public policy and social impact provides natural alignment for a program teaching students to address global challenges.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited public information:</strong> The venture has minimal public presence, making it difficult to assess team composition, traction, or specific program offerings. This lack of visibility may indicate very early stage development.</li>
        <li><strong>Crowded skills-based learning space:</strong> Many programs (Minerva, coding bootcamps, micro-credentials) address the skills gap. How to Change the World must differentiate its approach clearly to stand out.</li>
      </ul>
