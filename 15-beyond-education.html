    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Beyond Education provides digital assessment tools that help schools measure and develop students' soft skills (also called 21st-century skills or competencies), along with teacher professional development resources. The platform enables schools to track non-academic competencies that traditional tests miss.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Seed</strong> — Closed a seed investment round after completing the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator (equity-free). The company has conducted large-scale assessments with 100K+ students in Brazil. Active in 13+ countries.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Beyond Education through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator cohort announcements and subsequent podcast interviews with the founder. Michaela Horvathova's HGSE background in International Education Policy, combined with her prior work at OECD and advising education ministries across multiple countries, positions her as a credible voice in education reform. The company's traction in Brazil (100K+ student assessments) demonstrates product-market fit in a major emerging market.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Policy-level credibility:</strong> Horvathova's background includes work at OECD (contributing to the Education 2030 framework), advising the Slovak Prime Minister, and partnering with education ministries in Brazil, South Africa, Netherlands, and Czech Republic. This policy expertise opens doors for government-level adoption.</li>
        <li><strong>Large-scale validation:</strong> Conducting 100K+ student assessments in Brazil demonstrates the platform can operate at national scale. This case study is powerful evidence for pitching to other country-level education systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Measuring soft skills is inherently challenging:</strong> Unlike math or reading, soft skills lack standardized, universally accepted assessment methodologies. The platform may face skepticism from educators who question the validity and reliability of competency measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Government sales are slow and unpredictable:</strong> Selling to ministries of education involves long procurement cycles, political turnover risk, and budget dependencies on government priorities. This creates revenue volatility and extended time-to-close.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your assessment methodology — how do you ensure validity and reliability in measuring soft skills across different cultural contexts?</li>
      <li>What is your revenue model — licensing to governments, per-student fees, or school subscriptions?</li>
      <li>How long is your typical sales cycle with education ministries, and how do you manage political turnover risk?</li>
      <li>What outcomes data do you have linking Beyond Education assessments to student success (college readiness, employment outcomes)?</li>
      <li>Are you expanding into English-speaking markets (US, UK), and how do you plan to compete with established assessment companies like CASEL or ACT?</li>
    </ol>
