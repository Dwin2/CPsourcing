      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive global market with urgent need:</strong> The precision agriculture market is projected to exceed $15 billion by 2027. Climate change is making traditional farming methods less reliable, creating strong demand for predictive technologies that can optimize yields and reduce crop losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique gene expression approach:</strong> While many AgTech competitors focus on satellite imagery or soil sensors, Crop Diagnostix's use of gene expression analysis provides a differentiated, science-backed methodology that could offer more accurate predictions at the plant level.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex technology requiring farmer education:</strong> Gene expression analysis is sophisticated science that may be difficult for traditional farmers to understand and trust. Adoption may require significant education and demonstration of ROI.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability challenges in data collection:</strong> Gathering gene expression data at scale requires sample collection infrastructure that may be costly and logistically complex compared to purely remote-sensing approaches.</li>
