      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical infrastructure for a booming market:</strong> The robotics and autonomous systems market is experiencing explosive growth, with companies spending billions on AI development. High-quality training data is the foundation of these systems, and demand far outstrips supply, particularly for specialized robotics applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong founding team with NVC validation:</strong> Winning the HBS New Venture Competition provides significant credibility and access to the Harvard network. The co-founder team from HBS '25 brings fresh perspectives and strong business acumen to a technically complex space.</li>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crowded training data market:</strong> While robotics-specific data is specialized, the broader AI training data market includes well-funded competitors like Scale AI, Labelbox, and others who could expand into this niche.</li>
        <li><strong>Early stage with unproven technology:</strong> As a pre-seed company, Argus Systems has yet to demonstrate product-market fit at scale. The path from NVC win to sustainable revenue generation requires significant execution.</li>
