    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered CartaBio through the Harvard Innovation Labs venture directory while researching HMS-affiliated biotech startups. Spatial biology is one of the fastest-growing segments in life sciences, with the market expected to exceed $1B by 2027. CartaBio's combination of proprietary spatial biology with AI positions it at the intersection of two high-growth technology trends.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High-growth market segment:</strong> Spatial biology is one of the hottest areas in life sciences, driven by breakthroughs in understanding cellular microenvironments. The market is growing rapidly as pharmaceutical companies seek better tools for drug discovery and development.</li>
        <li><strong>Harvard Medical School credibility:</strong> HMS affiliation provides access to world-class researchers, clinical collaborators, and the Boston biotech ecosystem — critical advantages for an early-stage techbio company.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Competitive landscape with well-funded players:</strong> Spatial biology has attracted significant VC interest, with companies like 10x Genomics, Vizgen, and NanoString raising hundreds of millions. CartaBio must differentiate clearly against well-capitalized competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited public information:</strong> The venture has minimal public presence beyond Harvard directory listings, making it difficult to assess team depth, technology differentiation, or traction. Due diligence would require direct founder engagement.</li>
      </ul>
