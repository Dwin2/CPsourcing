    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Aperture Bio through the Harvard Innovation Labs venture directory while researching HBS-affiliated biotech startups. The company addresses a significant problem — nearly two-thirds of the 18M new cancer patients annually fail treatment due to resistance that isn't fully understood. Better tools to map tumor immune environments could improve patient selection for therapies and accelerate drug development.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addresses critical unmet need in oncology:</strong> Treatment resistance affects the majority of cancer patients, and current biomarker tools are "outdated, imprecise, and expensive." A platform that dramatically improves speed and sensitivity could command premium pricing from pharma and clinical labs.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform potential across multiple applications:</strong> Single-cell proteomics technology could serve drug development (pharma R&D partnerships), clinical trials (patient stratification), and eventually diagnostics — creating multiple revenue streams from one core platform.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital-intensive biotech development:</strong> Life science tools companies require significant R&D investment before commercial launch. Competing with established players (10x Genomics, Fluidigm) requires both technical differentiation and substantial capital.</li>
        <li><strong>Long validation timelines:</strong> Clinical and pharmaceutical customers require extensive validation before adopting new platforms. Sales cycles in life science tools can extend 12-24 months, requiring patience and capital.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>What is your current stage of product development — prototype, beta testing with partners, or commercial launch?</li>
      <li>How do you compare to established single-cell analysis platforms (10x Genomics, etc.) in terms of capabilities and pricing?</li>
      <li>What is your fundraising plan, and what milestones are you targeting before Series A?</li>

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with Aperture Bio?</p>
      <p>Hi [Founder First Name],</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following Aperture Bio's work in single-cell proteomics for tumor immune mapping and are impressed by your Harvard President's Innovation Challenge recognition and the platform's orders-of-magnitude improvements in speed and sensitivity for cancer biomarker analysis. Given your Harvard Business School affiliation, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support Aperture Bio's growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
