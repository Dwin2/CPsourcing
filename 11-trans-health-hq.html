    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Trans Health HQ through a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health news article about a startup winning the 2024 HBS New Venture Competition runner-up prize in the Social Impact Track. Cross-referencing the founder's background, I confirmed Ivan Hsiao's Harvard Chan '24 affiliation. The transgender healthcare space is critically underserved — 3 in 4 US doctors are unequipped to provide gender-affirming care — and the founder's personal experience navigating 600+ hours of care-seeking creates authentic founder-market fit.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deep founder-market fit:</strong> Ivan Hsiao is a transgender entrepreneur who personally experienced the healthcare system's failures, spending 600+ hours navigating gender-affirming care. This lived experience combined with formal public health training creates authentic understanding of both patient and provider pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Acute market need with institutional tailwinds:</strong> 1.6M+ transgender individuals in the US face significant healthcare barriers, while clinicians lack training. The recent BCBS/MassChallenge Health Equity Accelerator selection signals payer interest in solutions that could reduce costly emergency interventions.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Political and regulatory headwinds:</strong> Gender-affirming care faces active legislative opposition in many US states. The venture's success may be constrained by evolving state-by-state restrictions, and some health systems may hesitate to adopt tools that could draw political scrutiny.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue model clarity:</strong> It's unclear whether Trans Health HQ will monetize through B2B subscriptions to health systems, CME accreditation fees, or remain grant-funded as a nonprofit. The path to sustainable revenue in a mission-driven healthcare niche can be challenging.</li>
