    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered SOWCoders through an HGSE news article profiling Kavya Krishna's work on gender-based digital inequity. Krishna was also named among Forbes 30 Under 30 for her dedication to empowering girls in underserved communities. The organization addresses a clear gap — in many developing countries, girls face significant barriers to digital literacy — and has demonstrated scalable impact across 57 countries through a corporate partnership model.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Impressive scale and reach:</strong> Training 4,000+ girls across 57 countries demonstrates the model works internationally. The corporate partnership approach (Google, Deloitte, Malala Fund) provides funding and credibility while creating employee engagement opportunities for sponsors.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong founder recognition:</strong> Kavya Krishna's Forbes 30 Under 30 recognition and Phyllis Strimling Award from HGSE provide visibility and credibility that can open doors for partnerships and funding.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nonprofit revenue constraints:</strong> As a nonprofit dependent on corporate partnerships and grants, SOWCoders may face funding volatility. Corporate CSR budgets can be cut during economic downturns, creating sustainability risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact measurement challenges:</strong> While training numbers (4,000+ girls) are impressive, long-term outcomes (employment, income increases, career advancement) are harder to track across 57 countries. Demonstrating sustained impact will be important for continued donor support.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>What are the long-term outcomes for SOWCoders graduates — employment rates, income changes, or continued education in tech fields?</li>
      <li>How do you measure and report impact to corporate partners? What metrics matter most to them?</li>
      <li>What is your cost per girl trained, and how does that compare to other digital literacy programs?</li>
      <li>Are you considering any earned-revenue models (e.g., placement fees with tech employers, premium corporate training programs) to reduce grant dependency?</li>
      <li>How do you ensure curriculum relevance across 57 countries with different technology landscapes and employment markets?</li>
