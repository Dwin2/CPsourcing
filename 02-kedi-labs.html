    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered Kedi Labs through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs (HAE) Accelerator 2024 cohort announcement on PR Newswire, which listed 12 startups selected for the programme. Cross-referencing the founder's background, I confirmed Michelle Frye's Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health affiliation. The pet-health diagnostic space is a rapidly growing niche within digital health — the global pet diagnostics market is projected to exceed $3 B by 2028 — and Kedi Labs' DTC model with molecular-grade testing stood out as differentiated.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Founder-market fit:</strong> Michelle Frye combines a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine with a Harvard epidemiology degree and years of clinical practice. After selling her own vet practice, she identified the affordability gap firsthand — this is a deeply personal mission backed by real expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>Underserved, growing market:</strong> Rising vet costs (up 10%+ annually) and a 70 % US pet-ownership rate create strong demand for affordable at-home diagnostics. Kedi Labs targets rescues and underserved communities — a blue-ocean segment largely ignored by incumbents like IDEXX and Zoetis.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulatory and trust hurdles:</strong> At-home animal diagnostics lack the regulatory clarity of human diagnostics (no FDA equivalent for most pet tests). Convincing veterinarians to trust and recommend DTC test results — rather than in-clinic lab work — will require significant clinical validation and partnership effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrow initial go-to-market:</strong> The company's focus on rescues and underserved communities is mission-driven but represents a price-sensitive customer segment with lower lifetime value. Scaling revenue may require pivoting toward mainstream pet owners or B2B vet clinic partnerships.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is the accuracy rate of your rapid 10-minute tests compared to traditional in-clinic lab panels, and do you have published validation data?</li>
      <li>How do you handle cases where an at-home test indicates a serious condition — do you have a referral pathway or telehealth vet integration?</li>
      <li>What is your current customer acquisition cost and repeat purchase rate? Are pet owners buying kits as one-off diagnostics or on a subscription basis?</li>
      <li>Have you explored partnerships with pet insurance companies, who could subsidise or bundle your tests as part of their plans?</li>
      <li>What is your manufacturing and supply-chain setup — are the PCR kits produced in-house or through a contract manufacturer, and how does that affect your gross margin?</li>
    </ol>

      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners — Coffee Chat with Kedi Labs?</p>
      <p>Hi Michelle,</p>
      <p>I'm reaching out from <strong>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP)</strong>, a student-run investment group at Harvard focused on early-stage ventures led by Harvard-affiliated founders.</p>
      <p>We've been following Kedi Labs' work in at-home pet health diagnostics using molecular-grade PCR testing and are impressed by your unique approach to bringing vet-grade accuracy to underserved pet owners at consumer-friendly price points. Given your Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health background in epidemiology, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support Kedi Labs' growth.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting.</p>
      <p>Best,<br>[Your Name]<br>Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners</p>
