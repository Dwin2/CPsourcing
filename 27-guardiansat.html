    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>GuardianSat addresses space debris management in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), developing solutions to track, manage, and mitigate orbital debris that threatens critical satellite infrastructure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I discovered GuardianSat through the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator 2024 cohort announcement, where the company was highlighted as the Demo Day winner. Note: This venture is in the space/deep tech sector rather than Digital Health or Education — included here for completeness given the HAE Accelerator selection, but may not align with the assignment's vertical requirements.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical emerging market:</strong> Space debris is a growing threat as orbit becomes increasingly crowded. GEO contains the most valuable communication and weather satellites, making debris management there particularly important and potentially lucrative.</li>
        <li><strong>HAE Demo Day winner:</strong> Winning the accelerator's final competition demonstrates strong investor pitch capability and competitive positioning among peer startups.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not aligned with assignment verticals:</strong> GuardianSat is a space/deep tech company, not Digital Health or Education as specified in the HUCP assignment requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Capital-intensive space sector:</strong> Space technology typically requires significant R&D and hardware investment, with long development cycles and regulatory complexity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What specific technology or approach does GuardianSat use for space debris detection and management?</li>
      <li>Who are your target customers — satellite operators, space agencies, or insurance companies?</li>
      <li>What is the regulatory landscape for space debris management, and how does that affect your go-to-market strategy?</li>
