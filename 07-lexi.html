    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Lexi delivers real-time, voice-to-voice AI medical interpretation through a hardware + software ecosystem: the Lexi Pin (wearable for real-time translation), a Provider Panel integrated into clinical workflows, and a Patient App with post-visit summaries. The platform is fine-tuned for medical terminology and under-resourced languages like Haitian Creole and Vietnamese, and is HIPAA-compliant with end-to-end encryption.</p>

    <h3>4. Funding Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-Seed / Seed</strong> — Has won significant prize money including the $75,000 HBS New Venture Competition Grand Prize (2025), Social Impact Fellowship Fund, and multiple competition awards. Exact venture funding not publicly disclosed. The team spans 5 Harvard schools and MIT.</p>

    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>Discovered through the Harvard Innovation Labs' Spring 2025 milestones report, which highlighted its AI medical interpretation technology. Further research through the Harvard FXB Center revealed a detailed Q&amp;A with the founders describing their immigrant backgrounds and the product's development from a class project to a full venture.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive, underserved market with regulatory tailwinds:</strong> 30 million LEP (Limited English Proficiency) patients in the US face worse health outcomes due to language barriers. Hospitals spend millions annually on interpretation services and face legal requirements (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act) to provide language access. Lexi can cut costs by 50%+ while improving compliance — a compelling value proposition.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware + software moat:</strong> The combination of a purpose-built wearable (Lexi Pin), provider-facing panel, and patient app creates a multi-surface ecosystem that is harder for competitors to replicate than a software-only solution. The focus on under-resourced languages (vs. just Spanish/Mandarin) further differentiates.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High visibility and competition:</strong> Multiple major competition wins and media coverage mean Lexi faces elevated expectations and scrutiny from investors.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware complexity adds risk:</strong> Building, manufacturing, and distributing a physical wearable device (Lexi Pin) alongside software introduces supply-chain risk, higher unit costs, and longer iteration cycles compared to pure-software medical interpretation competitors (e.g., AMN Healthcare, LanguageLine).</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>What is your current go-to-market strategy — are you selling directly to hospital systems, going through GPOs/distributors, or targeting outpatient clinics first?</li>
      <li>How does your medical-terminology accuracy compare to existing solutions (e.g., Google Translate, AMN Healthcare) across your target languages, and do you have published benchmarks?</li>
      <li>What is the manufacturing plan for the Lexi Pin — are you using contract manufacturing, and what are your target unit costs and margins?</li>
      <li>How do you handle liability for translation errors in high-stakes medical situations — is there an escalation path to a human interpreter?</li>
      <li>What is your fundraising timeline, and are you primarily seeking healthcare-focused VCs or broader tech investors?</li>
    </ol>
