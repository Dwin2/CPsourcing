    <h3>5. How I Found the Company</h3>
    <p>I found GoTeacher through the Harvard Innovation Labs venture directory, which lists HGSE-affiliated startups in the education technology space. The company addresses a significant teacher pain point — lesson planning consumes an average of 7-12 hours per week for US teachers. The AI-driven approach to reducing this burden while maintaining pedagogical quality aligns with broader trends in generative AI for education.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addresses acute teacher pain point:</strong> Teachers spend 7-12 hours weekly on lesson planning, contributing to burnout and the ongoing teacher shortage. An AI tool that reduces this burden while maintaining quality could see strong adoption and word-of-mouth growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative focus differentiates:</strong> Most AI lesson planning tools are individual-user focused. GoTeacher's emphasis on collaborative planning enables department-wide and school-wide adoption, increasing stickiness and average contract value.</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crowded AI lesson planning market:</strong> Multiple well-funded competitors (MagicSchool AI, Eduaide.AI, Curipod) are targeting AI-assisted lesson planning. GoTeacher must differentiate clearly on features, integration, or market segment to avoid being commoditized.</li>
        <li><strong>K-12 sales cycles are long and complex:</strong> Selling to schools requires navigating procurement processes, budget cycles, and administrator buy-in. Customer acquisition costs in K-12 edtech are notoriously high, which can challenge early-stage unit economics.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>7. Five Questions for the Team</h3>
    <ol class="questions-list">
      <li>How many schools or teachers are currently using GoTeacher, and what does your engagement data look like (weekly active users, lessons created)?</li>
      <li>What is your go-to-market strategy — direct sales to districts, bottoms-up freemium adoption by teachers, or partnerships with curriculum providers?</li>
      <li>How does GoTeacher integrate with existing school technology stacks (Google Classroom, Canvas, SIS systems)?</li>
      <li>What is your approach to standards alignment — do you support multiple state standards and international curricula?</li>
      <li>How do you ensure AI-generated suggestions are pedagogically sound and age-appropriate? Is there a human review layer?</li>
