  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Urgent market need with regulatory tailwinds:</strong> The US faces a shortage of 500,000+ nurses, and hospitals are spending billions on expensive travel nurses and agency staff. M7 Health's software directly addresses this crisis, and regulatory pressure to improve nurse-to-patient ratios creates sustained demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Proven traction and scalability:</strong> With 60+ hospitals already using the platform and a $17M Series A, M7 Health has demonstrated product-market fit and the ability to scale. This traction significantly de-risks the investment compared to earlier-stage companies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Long healthcare sales cycles:</strong> Selling software to hospitals involves lengthy procurement processes, complex stakeholder management, and often requires extensive compliance and security reviews. This can slow growth and increase customer acquisition costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive landscape includes large incumbents:</strong> Healthcare workforce management is a space with established players like Kronos (UKG), API Healthcare, and others. M7 Health must differentiate strongly to win against vendors with existing hospital relationships.</li>
      </ul>
