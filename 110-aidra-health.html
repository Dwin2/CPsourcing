    <h3>3. Product Overview</h3>
    <p>Aidra Health is building Africa's first medical equipment-sharing marketplace, enabling healthcare facilities to share expensive diagnostic and treatment equipment. The platform addresses the critical shortage of medical equipment across African healthcare systems by maximizing utilization of existing assets. Hospitals with underutilized equipment can generate revenue by sharing with facilities that need access, while smaller clinics gain access to advanced diagnostics without massive capital investments.</p>

  <div class="strengths-weaknesses">
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addressing massive infrastructure gap with innovative model:</strong> Africa has less than 1% of the world's medical equipment despite having 17% of the global population and 25% of the disease burden. The sharing economy model maximizes existing resources without requiring massive capital investment in new equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>First-mover advantage in underserved market:</strong> As the first medical equipment-sharing marketplace in Africa, Aidra Health can establish network effects and brand recognition before competitors enter. The platform model becomes more valuable as more facilities join.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex logistics and quality assurance:</strong> Sharing medical equipment across facilities requires robust logistics, maintenance protocols, and quality assurance to ensure equipment functions properly and meets safety standards. This operational complexity may be challenging to manage.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory and liability considerations:</strong> Medical equipment is highly regulated, and sharing arrangements raise questions about liability, maintenance responsibility, and compliance with health authorities across different African countries.</li>
      </ul>

The sharing economy model is a creative solution with potential for massive impact.</p>
      <p>Given your HBS '26 background and the exciting mission driving Aidra Health, we'd love to learn more about your vision and explore how HUCP might support your journey.</p>
      <p>Would you be open to a 20-minute coffee chat or call in the coming weeks? We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your HBS schedule.</p>
